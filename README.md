- Hi I am Alfred Loran
- I am a Developer / DevOps Engineer who has a lot of fun to try things out. Besides this I am a trainer as well.
- I have no special interests here on GitHub. Just trying out some programming languages and some different types of multimedia apllications. 
- I'll create a platform for Java Beginner and which, I hope, my trainees will use as well.
